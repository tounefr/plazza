             weapons to spend all your money is advisable as it can be sold
             in the next shop. If you have higher than 1 power on a weapon

Specific hints :-

Level 1 - The perfect cash score is 1100.
Level 3 - Second half is the 'MAZE', go left then right, left, right ECT.
Level 4 - Shop 1. Be careful even though you have enough cash to buy a
          Macro Laser DO NOT sell your cannon to buy another as you are
          wasting plenty of money.
