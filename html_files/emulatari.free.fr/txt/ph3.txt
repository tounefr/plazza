      The Quest


The adventurer strode in through the front gate,  past the  giant 
cracked doors,  and up to a merchant who leaned against an  empty 
pickle barrel.  "Merchant,  where am I,  anyway?" he  asked.  The 
merchant  perked  up at the  question.  "Why,  you're  in  lovely 
Pendragon," he cried,  "Crossroads of Scandor,  hub of  commerce, 
and jewel of civilization."
      The adventurer looked around at the crumbling mortar on the 
high towers and the slump-shouldered tread of the citizenry.  "Is 
this a jewel or a piece of glass?" he asked.  "What has  befallen 
this metropolis?"
      "You are sharp," the merchant replied.  "Pendragon, nay all 
of  Scandor,  is  but a shadow of its  former  glory.  Travel  is 
dangerous,  the populace is fearful,  and even the cows no longer 
give  milk.  The  monsters rise from the hills and  the  pounding 
boots of the conqueror are not far from our ancient gates."
      "Monsters? A conqueror?" questioned the adventurer. "Who is 
it that threatens the entire continent of Scandor?"
      The  merchant  glanced  one  way,  then  the  other.  In  a 
whispered voice he said, "The evil sorcerer Nikademus has finally 
come to these shores."
      "But  Nikademus's  plans  on  the  islands  of  Gelnor  and 
Ferronrah were thwarted!" the adventurer cried,  "and his crystal 
on the Pookney Islands has been shattered!"
      "Ah,  a historian!" mused the merchant. "Those were but the 
first  two  acts of Nikademus's foul play.  The finale is  to  be 
enacted here on Scandor. Nikademus has learned from these losses. 
His  power is now such that he can sway even the purest to  evil. 
His  army has swelled to far larger than  Scandor's  disorganized 
forces. If only there was a force to stop Nikademus. Even a small 
group,  with sufficient courage,  might do it. But, alas, none of 
sufficient  calibre  have  appeared."  The  merchant  sighed,  "I 
suppose Scandor is doomed!"
      "Never!" roared the adventurer.  "I myself have the courage 
of a lion!  With some stout fellows I am sure we could rout  this 
pretender Nikademus!"
      "How bold you are," said the merchant,  "perhaps you  could 
find other bold fellows at the Guild Hall."
      "I  shall  go  there at once!" cried  the  adventurer  with 
determination.  He moved to stride off toward the Guild Hall  but 
then stopped and turned.  "But Scandor is a great continent and I 
am a newcomer here. How am I to find Nikademus?"
      "The  Pendragon  Archives just to the south were  once  the 
finest  collection  of  scroll and  knowledge  in  the  civilized 
world," said the merchant. "Though they say that the scribes have 
gone  mad and the archives overrun,  perhaps you could find  more 
information  there.  Try to find a wise man named Filmon;  he  is 
almost a legend in these parts."
      "I   thank  you  for  your  information,   merchant,"   the 
adventurer  said.  "I  am  off to gather a hearty  band  to  free 
Scandor!"
      "Luck  be with you!" the merchant yelled as the  adventurer 
squared  his  massive shoulders and  strode  away.  The  merchant 
smiled  to  himself;  another crazy soul off  on  the  impossible 
quest.  But someone,  someday,  had to defeat Nikademus or all of 
Scandor would fall.  Who was to say that this adventurer wouldn't 
be the one?


Welcome to PHANTASIE III,  the third adventure in the epic battle 
against  the evil sorcerer Nikademus.  You need not  have  played 
either  PHANTASIE  I or II to get full enjoyment  from  PHANTASIE 
III.

      In   PHANTASIE  III  you  will  control  a  party  of   six 
adventurers.  They  will  start as raw  beginners,  but  as  they 
adventure through the wilderness and into the dungeons they  will 
grow  in power,  skill,  and wealth.  During the course of  their 
adventures the party will gather scrolls and meet beings who  can 
give clues to the source of the calamity befalling the  continent 
of Scandor.  The adventurers can use their knowledge and power to 
bring about a resolution to Scandor's plight.
      This rule book will be your guide to using PHANTASIE III on 
your computer. If you've already played a number of fantasy/quest 
games in the past then you can turn to the Quick Start Section in 
Appendix I.  If you've already played PHANTASIE I or II then just 
turn  to the Differences Between PHANTASIE III and PHANTASIE I  & 
II  Section  in Appendix II to catch the changes that  have  been 
made  in the new game.  If you haven't played any of these  games 
before,  don't  worry!  This  rule book will  give  you  complete 
instructions  on how to play the game,  and some hints on how  to 
win it!
      The  rules  begin  with the General  Rules  that  apply  to 
PHANTASIE   III   on  all  computers.   The   Computer   Specific 
Instructions  refer  to changes in the game that help  take  best 
advantage of each different computer.  Finally,  the Quick  Start 
and Differences Sections will help old hands get into playing the 
game  as quickly as possible.  So let's get started -  there  are 
quests to be completed and great deeds to be done!


ADVENTURERS

The  basic unit in PHANTASIE III is a party of  six  adventurers. 
The party will move together, fight together, and gain experience 
and  treasure together.  Adventurers who have been badly  injured 
can be dropped from the party and new,  inexperienced adventurers 
added  whenever the party is in a town.  The capabilities of  the 
party will depend on the powers and skills of the adventurers  it 
contains.
      Each  adventurer  is  defined by his  race,  his  class  or 
profession, his individual attributes, and his skill percentages. 
These allow great individualization among the  adventurers.  Many 
of  these factors interact;  high attributes lead to  high  skill 
percentages and Dwarf Fighters tend to be stronger than  Halfling 
Wizards.  The  descriptions and effects of the  different  races, 
classes, attributes, and skills follow. 
                 
RACES

An   adventurer's   race  refers  to  his   biological   species. 
Adventurers  in  PHANTASIE  III can be selected  from  among  the 
following major races:

Humans:  medium  sized  humanoids  who look like you  do  in  the 
mirror. They tend to be equally good at all professions.

Dwarves: shorter than humans, but tougher. They make up for their 
lack of speed and charm with muscle and grit.

Elves:  lithe,  thin,  beautiful creatures who make up for  their 
lack of muscle with grace and intelligence.

Gnomes:  like dwarves, only shorter. Not quite so clumsy, but not 
quite so strong either.

Halflings:   very  short,  fast,  and  tougher  than  they  look. 
Halflings are surprisingly intelligent and worthy adventurers.

Random Creatures

Some  adventurers  come from the less civilized  humanoid  races, 
referred to here as random creatures.  Nobody actually likes  the 
members of this motley crew so they must pay much larger training 
fees and stay in the back rooms at the inn.


                             PAGE 1
------------------------------------------------------------------

Random creatures tend to have low Charisma scores,  and can  only 
be Fighters and Thieves.  I  f you select a random creature  your 
adventurer's race will be chosen from among the following:

Gnolls:  dog faced humanoids,  and proud of it. Gnolls are strong 
and tough, but ugly and not very bright.

Goblins: loathsome little guys; short like gnomes but with few of 
their advantages.

Kobolds:  very short,  quick,  and tough little monsters. Kobolds 
aren't very bright or beautiful, but they can be survivors.

Lizard  Men:  7  foot,  scaly hunks of  muscle.  Lizard  men  are 
humanoid ...  barely ...  with great tails,  claws,  and a forked 
tongue. They eat like pigs but swim like lizards.

Minotaurs: powerful humanoids with the head of a bull, or is that 
powerful humanoids who are bull headed? Either way, Minotaurs are 
tough, but not quick, strong, but not smart.
Ogres:  huge,  ugly  humanoids who are very strong,  but  not  as 
strong  as trolls,  and tough,  but not as tough  as  trolls.  Of 
course  they  are also smarter,  more agile,  and  prettier  than 
trolls ... which isn't saying much.

Orcs:  like  a  gnoll,  but  not  as tough  or  strong  but  more 
intelligent and prettier.

Pixies:  small fairy creatures with pointed ears and  transparent 
wings.  Pixies are physically puny,  but they are very quick  and 
intelligent.

Sprites:  fairy-like creatures who are even quicker than  pixies. 
Their high dexterity makes them effective thieves.

Trolls:  just about the biggest,  strongest, toughest, stupidest, 
clumsiest, and ugliest creature around. What more can I say?


CLASSES

Each   adventurer  specializes  into  one  of  six   classes   or 
professions.   These   classes  define  what  the  character   is 
especially  good at and what he specializes in.  The six  classes 
are:

Fighters:  the  sword and shield of the party.  Fighters are  the 
masters of melee combat. Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, and some random 
creatures make the best fighters.

Monks: jacks of all trades and masters of none. Monks are average 
fighters,  know  some  thieving skills,  and have  a  few  combat 
spells.  Because of the low number of spells they can learn, they 
must pick their spells carefully.  Humans,  elves,  and halflings 
make good monks.

Priests:  medic!  Priests  are  average in combat but  have  many 
defensive  and,  most important,  healing spells.  Make sure  the 
party priest is on your side! Humans make the best priests.

Rangers:  have sword,  will travel. Rangers are almost as good in 
combat as fighters,  and know a number of priestly spells. Humans 
and Dwarves make good Rangers.

Thieves:  masters of the five-finger discount!  Thieves are  poor 
melee fighters,  but excellent bowmen and skilled  professionals. 
With  their stealth they can sneak into the second rank  and  hit 
monsters  fighters can't easily get to.  They are also  great  at 
spotting and dealing with traps and treasure.  Humans, Halflings, 
Gnomes, and some of the random creatures make good thieves.

Wizards:  "nothing  up my sleeve ..." Wizards are the masters  of 
magic.  They get the most spells and Magic Points.  They are poor 
in melee combat, but are masters of offensive spells and are very 
important in encounters with monsters. Humans and elves make good 
wizards.
ATTRIBUTES

Each adventurer has 5 main attributes that are based on his  race 
and class.  The value of each attribute ranges from 3 to 22. Each 
attribute  determines  a different  capability.  The  attribute's 
common abbreviation is listed after the attribute's name.

Strength (STR):  physical strength,  ability to use heavy weapons 
and equipment,  and damage in melee combat. Fighters need as much 
Strength as they can get.

Intelligence (INT):  mental prowess and the basis of the  ability 
to  cast spells.  Wizards,  Priests,  and Monks need a very  high 
Intelligence.


                             PAGE 2 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Dexterity  (DEX):  physical agility and a basis of  hitting  and, 
more important,  not getting hit by melee attacks. Dexterity also 
helps determine what weapons an adventurer can use, how good some 
of his skills are, and how well he can conjure a spell. Everybody 
needs Dexterity.

Constitution (CON): endurance, physical toughness, and a modifier 
on  the number of Hit Points an adventurer has.  The  higher  the 
adventurer's Constitution,  the more hit points he has,  and  the 
longer that he might live!

Charisma (CHA):  good looks,  charm,  and how to win friends  and 
influence  people.  Charisma  affects the cost of  a  character's 
training and learning new spells. Another reason why yucky random 
creatures pay more for training.


                  HOW ATTRIBUTES ARE DETERMINED

When a new adventurer is created,  his attributes are equal to  a 
random  value modified by the adventurer's class  and  race.  The 
following  charts give the Attribute Modifiers by Class  and  the 
Maximum Attributes by Race.

SKILLS

Each  adventurer has nine skills,  each rated with  a  percentage 
chance.  Situations  and  opponents can reduce  these  percentage 
chances  so that the actual probabilities can vary  widely.  Each 
time  an adventurer goes up a level he can increase his  training 
in three of his skills. The skills are:

Attack:  the adventurer's chance to hit an opponent in melee.  An 
enemy  may  have  a defence which subtracts from  this  and  some 
maneuvers may reduce the chance,  so high-level adventurers  will 
often have Attack skill over 100.

Parry:  the adventurer's chance to get his shield in the way when 
he does a parry maneuver.  It also makes the character harder  to 
hit even when not parrying.

Swim:  the  adventurer's chance to cross a water  square  without 
taking damage from drowning.

Listen:  the adventurer's chance to hear monsters coming.  If the 
party  hears  the monsters,  it can attempt to flee or  be  fully 
prepared when the encounter comes.

Spot Trap:  the adventurer's chance to spot a trap that has  been 
set for the party.  Once a trap has been spotted the party can do 
something about it.

Disarm Trap: the adventurer's chance to disarm a trap once it has 
been  spotted.  Only one adventurer will attempt the disarm at  a 
time.

Find Item:  the adventurer's chance to spot treasure and  goodies 
after  a  battle.  Monsters who surrender give their  items  over 
freely, but dead monsters tell no tales.

Pick Lock:  the adventurer's chance to pick the lock on a door in 
the dungeon.  The locks on some doors can not be picked and  must 
be opened in some other way.

Fire Bow: the adventurer's chance to hit his target when firing a 
bow. Some monsters have defences that reduce this chance.


                           PAGE 3     
-----------------------------------------------------------------
SOCIAL CLASS

Each  adventurer  has a social class which denotes his  place  in 
society.   The  four  social  classes  are:   Peasant,   Laborer, 
Craftsman,and Noble.  Humans, Elves and Dwarves tend to be in the 
higher classes.  The adventurer's class determines how much  gold 
he gets to start and how much he gets for going up a  level;  the 
higher the social class the more gold the adventurer receives.


TOWNS

Starting and Ending

Each  session  of PHANTASIE III begins and ends in  a  town.  The 
party  will  begin in town number  1,  Pendragon.  Each  town  is 
identified  by  a  name and number.  Towns provide  a  number  of 
facilities for the party and serve as havens from monsters.
      Each  town  operates  exactly the same  way.  In  each  the 
adventurers will find the same facilities: a Guild where they can 
train  and find fellow adventurers;  a Bank where they  can  keep 
their money;  an Armoury where they can buy equipment;  a  Mystic 
from  whom they can find out how far along on the  quest  they've 
come;  and an Inn where they can rest and heal.  Adventurers  can 
also  perform  several  maintenance functions in  towns  such  as 
Casting  a spell,  Using an item,  Distributing items  among  the 
party, Inspecting an adventurer in detail, or Saving the game.
      Actions in town are controlled by the Town Menu.  The  Town 
Menu is divided into two sections: places to go and things to do.

Town Menu: Go To

The  top  menu  gives the commands that take  the  party  to  the 
various locations in town:  The Guild, The Bank, The Armoury, The 
Mystic, The Inn, and Leave town. New players must go to The Guild 
to gather the adventurers for a party.

The Guild

The  Guild  is where adventurers are generated  and  formed  into 
parties.  Dozens of different adventurers can be recorded in  the 
guild, but only six will be in a party at a time.
      The  Guild  Menu  contains two  kinds  of  commands:  Guild 
Commands  and  Party Commands.  The Guild  Commands  provide  the 
following options:

Guild Commands

* Create a New member of the Guild
* List the members of the Guild
* Purge an adventurer from the Guild
* Add a member of the Guild to the party.

New Member: this option creates new members of the guild one at a 
time.  New members should be carefully chosen.  You must find the 
optimal  mix  of classes and races to survive  and  complete  the 
quest.  A  reasonable beginning party has been pre-generated  and 
pre-equipped  and is listed as the first 6 members of the  Guild. 
You may choose to use these adventurers or create your own.
      Once  the  race  and  class of  the  adventurer  have  been 
selected his attributes will be displayed.  If the attributes are 
acceptable  the adventurer will be assigned a name and listed  on 
the Guild roster.  Then the adventurer's full list of  statistics 
will  be shown along with his starting equipment (See Town  Menu: 
Inspect for a full explanation of the display).

List:  this  option  shows  all  of the  Guild  members  and  the 
following  information:  Their number in the Guild (Apple  only), 
their name,  their class,  and the number of the town where  they 
are now. The last three names on the list: Mud, Mist, and Air are 
not adventurers at all.  They are the ELEMENTALS that a wizard or 
monk  summons with the Summon Elemental Spell.  Notice that  they 
are fighters,  that they have guild numbers, and that they reside 
in town 0 which is not found on the material plane. One Elemental 
can  be  added to the party.  It does not count as a  member  and 
simply defines which elemental will come when the summoning spell 
is cast.


                             PAGE 4
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Purge:  this option drops an adventurer from the guild list, from 
the party,  and out of the game, never to be seen again. Use with 
caution.

Add to Party:  this option will add an adventurer from the  Guild 
list  to the party.  The adventurer will still be listed  on  the 
Guild List.

Party Commands

* Spells
* Training
* Drop From Party
* Rename a Party Member

Spells:  this option allows an adventurer to attempt to learn new 
spells.  The number of spells the adventurer can learn,  the cost 
of  each  attempt  to learn the spell,  and  the  specific  spell 
numbers the adventurer can choose from will be listed.  The  cost 
of  learning  the spell comes from the party  treasury,  not  the 
adventurer's  bank  account.   If  there  are  no  numbers  after 
"POSSIBLE SPELLS:",  then the adventurer can learn no new  spells 
at this time.

Training:  this option allows an adventurer who has gained enough 
Experience  Points  to  go  up a level  and  increase  his  skill 
percentages.  When training the adventurer will be told how  many 
experience points he needs to go up a level; or, if he has enough 
experience points,  then how many gold pieces will be required to 
pay for the training.  Gold to pay for the training comes out  of 
the party treasury and not the adventurer's bank account.
      When the adventurer has enough experience points and  gold, 
the training can begin.  The adventurer will gain additional  Hit 
Points for going up a level.  He will also get to train up  three 
of his skills.  Each skill will be listed along with its  current 
value and its new value after training.  The adventurer may train 
in  the same skill more than once,  but the advantage  gained  is 
decreased each time.  After all training the party should get out 
of  the  Guild and into the Inn to rest up their  Hit  Points  to 
their new maximum.

Drop  From  Party:  this option takes the adventurer off  of  the 
party roster.  The adventurer is still on the Guild List and  can 
be  put  back into the party any time the party is  in  the  same 
town.

Rename:  this  option allows the player to change the name  of  a 
member of the party.

Exit Guild: this option returns the Adventurers to the Town Menu.

THE BANK
The Bank has an account for each adventurer,  and there are  Bank 
branches  in every Scandorian town.  Adventurers can withdraw  or 
deposit money at any branch.
      When  each adventurer is created he is given an  amount  of 
gold  in his account.  Before an adventurer can buy equipment  at 
the Armoury or Spells at the Guild his gold needs to be withdrawn 
from his account and put into the party treasury.  A party in the 
wilderness should carry enough gold to cover stays at independent 
inns,  bribes,  or purchases in the dungeon.  Each of these costs 
about 250 gold.      When adventurers first enter the  Bank,  the 
amount of Gold the party is carrying is displayed along with  the 
following options:

* Withdraw Gold Pieces
* Deposit Carried Gold
* Exit Bank

Withdraw  Gold  Pieces:  this option allows  each  adventurer  to 
withdraw  gold  from  his  account and  put  it  into  the  party 
treasury.  From there on only the total gold carried by the party 
will be shown. A party can carry up to 65,000 Gold Pieces.

Deposit  Carried  Gold:  this option allows  the  adventurers  to 
divide  the  party's gold into shares and deposit it  into  their 
bank accounts.  Each adventurer will get either 1,2,  or 3 shares 
of  the  party's  gold  and  the value  of  each  share  will  be 
displayed.  An  adventurer's bank account can hold a  maximum  of 
65,000 Gold Pieces.  A small banking fee will be charged at every 
deposit.

Exit Bank: this option returns the adventurers to the Town Menu.

                             PAGE 5  
----------------------------------------------------------------

THE ARMOURY

The  armoury  is  actually a general purpose  store  that  stocks 
weapons,  armour, shields, scrolls, potions, and other treasures. 
The  armourer buys his inventory from crazy adventurers who  come 
into  town  to sell the treasures they found on  their  journeys. 
Other  adventurers can then purchase the treasures and  equipment 
from the armourer (at a profit to the armourer, of course).
      The  stocks of scrolls and other treasures in  the  armoury 
remain  for future visits.  However,  the stocks of  weapons  and 
potions can change each time the party enters.
      When  the  party  enters the  Armoury,  one  adventurer  is 
defined  as  the buyer.  A list of the Armoury Commands  will  be 
displayed. To make purchases list the Armoury inventory. The list 
will show the item Number (used to buy the item),  the item Name, 
the  Cost (in gold pieces),  and the Point Value of  Weapons  and 
Equipment.  If  the  buyer does not have  the  necessary  minimum 
attributes to use an item, the item will be listed as Unusable.
      The  Equipment Section gives the description of  the  items 
available in the Armoury.  To complete a purchase, choose the Buy 
Item  option and the Item Number.  The Item will be added to  the 
adventurer's inventory and the money will be subtracted from  the 
party treasury.
      Remember  that an adventurer can only use one  weapon,  one 
shield,  one suit of armour, and one bow. This equipment is never 
lost,  stolen,  or destroyed.  Armour and Shields have a  minimum 
Strength Requirement. Bows and Weapons have a minimum Combination 
of  Strength and Dexterity.  Magic Armour and Weapons have  lower 
requirements.
      A complete list of the options at the Armoury include:
* List Items                * Another Shopper
* Continue List             * Exit Armoury
* Buy Item

List  Items:  this  option  lists the first dozen  items  in  the 
Armoury's inventory.

Continue  List:  this  option lists the next dozen items  in  the 
Armoury's  inventory.  If the Armoury has a lot of items  in  its 
inventory  the  adventurers  may need to use  the  Continue  List 
option several times to see all of the items.
Buy  Item:  this  option purchases the item and puts  it  in  the 
adventurer's  inventory.  If  the adventurer gets  a  "You  can't 
Afford That" message, the price is higher than the amount of gold 
in the party treasury.

Another  Shopper:  this  option allows the party  to  change  the 
adventurer who is shopping.

Exit Armoury: this option takes the party to the Town Menu.

THE MYSTIC

The  mystic will give the party an overall score that  represents 
how  far  they have proceeded on the quest and a  rating  of  how 
experienced the adventurers are.

THE INN

Adventurers who stay at the Inn have all of their Hit Points  and 
Magic Points restored to their maximum. Inns located in towns are 
free,  while independent inns in the wilderness cost 250 Gold per 
stay. Characters who have cast spells while in the wilderness may 
have their maximum number of Magic Points increased.

LEAVE TOWN

The Leave Town Option takes the party into the wilderness.

TOWN MENU: OTHER OPTIONS
Adventurers  can perform a number of other actions in  town.  The 
actions we can talk about include Casting a Spell, Using an Item, 
Distributing  Items  among  adventurers,   Trading  Items   among 
adventurers, Inspecting an adventurer, and Saving the Game.

Cast  a Spell:  this option allows an adventurer to  throw  those 
spells that can be used in town such as healing or transportation 
(see list of Magic Spells for details).

Use an Item:  this option allows an adventurer to read a  scroll, 
quaff a potion,  or find the unusual properties of an item.  Some 
items,  like scrolls,  can only be used in town.  The  adventurer 
carrying  the item to be used is specified.  An inventory of  the 
items  that the adventurer is carrying is  displayed.  Input  the 
number of the appropriate item to use it.


                             PAGE 6 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribute and Sell Items: this option allows the party to gather 
all  of its equipment into one big pile and distribute  it  among 
the  party.  Anything the party doesn't want can be sold  to  the 
Armoury.    
      The items carried by the party will be listed,  along  with 
which adventurers have the necessary attributes to use the  item. 
Items  are  listed from best to worst  in  each  category,  first 
magical items and then non-magical items.
      It  is  a good idea to have all six of  the  party  members 
together before you redistribute items. It is also a good idea to 
redistribute items to their proper owner before saving the  game. 
Remember  that  each adventurer can only carry nine  items  at  a 
time.

Trade Items:  this option allows an adventurer to give one of his 
items to someone else in the party,  or to sell one of his  items 
to the Armoury. If only a few items are involved, it is faster to 
trade items than to redistribute them.
      First define the adventurer with the item to be  traded.  A 
list  of all of the items in his inventory will be  listed.  Then 
specify the item number to be traded and the party number of  who 
the  item will be traded to.  An adventurer may sell the item  to 
the Armoury by trading it to adventurer 7.

Inspect  Party Member:  this option gives the statistics  for  an 
adventurer  in the party.  Define the adventurer to be  inspected 
and his statistics will be displayed.
      The  display  includes  the  adventurer's  full  name,  his 
continent of origin, his level, race, class, physical status, and 
social   class.   The  display  also  includes  a  list  of   the 
adventurer's  attributes,   skill  percentages,  spells,  general 
statistics,  and equipment. After the display of the adventurer's 
statistics, a display of the state of the adventurer's body parts 
is listed.

Attributes:  these  are listed in the first column along  with  a 
LUCK score (randomly determined from 8 to 13).  These  attributes 
are  the basis of how many tasks are performed  (See  description 
under Individual Attributes).

Skills: these are listed in two columns under the attributes. The 
nine skills include:  Attack,  Parry,  Swim,  Listen,  Spot Trap, 
Disarm Trap, Find Item, Pick Lock, and Fire Bow. The numbers list 
the percentage chance to perform a task based on the skill,  such 
as SWIM 45 means a 45% chance to swim without taking damage  (see 
description under Skills).

Spells:  the number representing the spells the adventurer  knows 
are  listed  under the skills.  SPELLS 1 5 means  the  adventurer 
knows Healing 1 and Fireflash 1.

Age:  the age of the adventurer in years.  Age adversely  affects 
the adventurer's attributes after he reaches his declining years. 
Each race has a different life span; elves live about 3000 years, 
dwarves  and gnomes live about 200 years,  humans live  about  80 
years, and most others croak off after only 40 to 50 years.

Hit Points:  two numbers:  the adventurer's current hit points  / 
the  adventurer's total hit points.  The current hit points  will 
fall  when  the  adventurer is damaged and rise  again  when  the 
adventurer  is  healed  or  completes a  stay  in  the  Inn  (See 
Mortality and Hit Points in the Encounters Section).
Magic: two numbers again: the adventurer's current Magic Points / 
the  adventurer's total Magic Points.  The current  Magic  Points 
will fall as the adventurer throws spells and rise again when the 
adventurer takes a magic potion or completes a stay in the Inn.

Gold in Bank: the number of Gold Pieces the adventurer has in his 
bank  account.  This  does  not include any  Gold  the  party  is 
carrying.

Experience Points: the number of Experience Points the adventurer 
has  accumulated by killing monsters.  The number  of  Experience 
Points an adventurer needs to go up a level depends on his  race, 
attributes,  and  class.  The adventurer's level  determines  his 
maximum hit points, maximum number of spells that can be learned, 
etc.

Score: how far the adventurer has progressed along the quest.


                             PAGE 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Equipment:  this  lists  the  weapon,  armour,  shield,  bow  and 
equipment  that  an adventurer carries.  The point value  of  the 
combat  equipment is listed in brackets - the higher the  number, 
the more effective the equipment. An adventurer can carry a total 
of nine items.

Body Parts:  the state of the adventurer's Head, Torso, Arms, and 
legs is listed.  Each area can be Okay, Injured, Broken, or Gone. 
Injured  Body  Areas  can be cured with rest  in  the  Inn.  More 
drastic  problems can be cured with high level Healing Spells  or 
powerful Healing Potions.


SAVE GAME

The  Save Game option can only be accomplished in a  town.  Every 
time the party leaves a town the game is saved automatically.  If 
you're  playing  on an Apple,  make sure you remember  the  Guild 
Number  of  the adventurers in your party;  you'll need  them  to 
restart a saved game.


                     BEGINNING THE ADVENTURE

Once  the  adventurers  leave town they will  embark  upon  their 
quest.  They will wander through the untamed  wilderness,  inside 
horrid dungeons, and even into alternate planes of good and evil.
      When  not  in  town  the adventurers will  be  shown  on  a 
complete display that is split into several different areas.  The 
upper area shows the adventurers themselves.  This area  includes 
the adventurer's name,  class,  current:  maximum number of Magic 
Points, current: maximum number of Hit Points, and a stick figure 
representation of the adventurer showing the status of his  Head, 
Torso, Arms, and Legs. 
Each body area can be: Okay (O), Injured (I), Broken (B), or Gone 
(G)(See  Melee for a full description of the effects of  injuries 
on  body  areas).  The adventurer's status is  also  listed;  the 
adventurer  can  be:   Okay,   Down,   Sleeping,   Dead,  or  Out 
(unconscious).
      The  center  of  the screen is  split  into  two  different 
windows.   The   left  window  includes  messages   and   terrain 
descriptions.  The right window will show the Rank and Status  of 
monsters when the adventurers are in combat.
      The lower part of the screen is split into three  different 
windows. The left window shows a map of the area of wilderness or 
dungeon  the adventurers are in.  The adventurers are assumed  to 
have maps of the wilderness, so all terrain in the area is shown. 
The  map  of  the dungeon will be  blank  until  the  adventurers 
explore  it.  The  center window shows the menu  of  options  the 
adventurers have at this time. The right window shows the figures 
of  the  adventurers and the monsters that  they  encounter  (See 
Melee for more information on Combat).

THE WILDERNESS
The area outside of towns and dungeons is called the  wilderness. 
The  Wilderness  display  always  shows a map  of  the  area  the 
adventurers are in along with the regular party information.  The 
Wilderness menu includes the following options:

Wilderness Menu

* Cast
* Inspect
* Use
* Time Lag
* Move North
* Move South
* Move East
* Move West

Cast:  this  option  allows an adventurer to cast  non-combat  or 
wilderness spells (See Magic section for details).

Inspect:  this option displays the time the party has been out of 
town,  the Experience Points earned since the last time in  town, 
the  number of Gold Pieces the party is carrying,  and the  items 
the party has acquired since the last time in town.  It will also 
display an individual adventurer's basic stats, including Hit and 
Magic Points,  Spells known,  usable Potions carried, and Attack, 
Parry, Swim, Listen, and Fire percentages.

Use:  this  option  allows an adventurer to use a  potion  he  is 
carrying,  either  on  himself or on another  party  member.  The 
adventurer  with  the item is specified and then a  list  of  his 
potions  is  displayed.  The adventurer selects  the  appropriate 
potion  from  his list and then selects the  recipient  (See  the 
items section for the effects of potions).

                             PAGE 8
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Time Lag: this option changes the speed of melee action: 0 speeds 
it  up and 9 slows it down.  The sound may also be turned on  and 
off at this time.

Move North,  South, East, West: Moves the party one square. North 
is at the top of the map.
      The  map  of Scandor is divided into 25 sections  that  are 
identified by A-E (West to East) and I-V (North to South). As the 
party moves off the map, a new map will be displayed.
      The adventurers must attempt to swim any water obstacles on 
the map,  be they lakes, seas, or rivers. If any adventurer fails 
his  swimming  percentage,  then he flounders and  takes  damage. 
Adventurers  with few hit points are in real danger  of  drowning 
when crossing water.
      Independent Inns are scattered about Scandor. These provide 
the same rest and healing as the Inns in towns,  but they  charge 
250 Gold Pieces (plus tax).

DUNGEONS
When the party enters the square with a dungeon, the dungeon will 
be  identified and the party asked if it wants to  enter.  A  Yes 
answer puts the party in the dungeon. You will have to put in the 
dungeon  disk  if you are playing an 8-bit version  of  PHANTASIE 
III.  Once in the dungeon the party is given a chance to leave. A 
No answer keeps the party in the dungeon.
      In  the dungeon the Wilderness map is replaced by  a  blank 
dungeon  map.  Only  those areas that the  party  has  previously 
explored  will be shown on the map.  As the party  explores,  the 
layout of the dungeon will be revealed.

Dungeon Menu
The  dungeon  menu has the same features as the  wilderness  menu 
plus a new option: Look. All of the options function just as they 
do in the wilderness menu.

Look:  this option reveals the layout of the dungeon for  several 
squares in each direction.  It will not see through  walls.  Some 
rooms  are so big that a Look option will not reveal  the  entire 
area.

SKILLS IN THE DUNGEON

Listen: adventurers automatically listen at doors in the dungeon. 
If  the  adventurers hear anything they will give the  option  to 
turn back.

Pick  Lock,   Spot  Item,   and  Spot  Trap:   these  skills  are 
automatically attempted at the appropriate times. Success depends 
on the adventurer's percentages in these skills.

Disarm Trap:  whenever a trap is spotted,  the party is given the 
option of trying to disarm the trap or leave. Only one adventurer 
will  get the chance to disarm a trap (normally a Thief  or  Monk 
who has a high Disarm percentage).

Leaving the Dungeon:  the party may only leave the dungeon at  an 
exit.Whenever  the party gets to an exit,  it will be  given  the 
opportunity  to leave.  A Yes answer puts the party back  in  the 
wilderness.  When the party leaves the dungeon, you will be given 
the choice of saving the dungeon status or not.
      When adventurers enter a dungeon for the second  time,  the 
monsters may be ready for them;  new traps may be set,  new locks 
on the doors,  and new monsters may be in the  dungeon.  Monsters 
can only do so much redecorating in a short time, however, and if 
the party returns shortly after it left, then the monsters it has 
killed might still be dead.

ENCOUNTERS

Your  party will inevitably encounter monsters in the  wilderness 
or in the dungeon.  While some monsters may not be hostile,  they 
will  never  be  helpful.  The  risk is  high  --  death  to  the 
unprepared and inexperienced.
      When the party encounters monsters you will  see:  MONSTERS 
APPROACH on the screen.  Then the picture of the monsters,  their 
name,  rank,  and  status  will appear.  Monsters in rank  1  are 
closest to the party. Finally the Encounter Menu will appear. The 
Encounter Menu includes the following options:

Encounter Menu

* Fight
* Accept Monster's Surrender
* Greet Monsters
* Beg for Mercy from Monsters
* Flee


                             PAGE 9
------------------------------------------------------------------
Fight:  this option takes the adventurers directly into melee, no 
quarter is asked for or given (See Melee rules).

Accept Surrender:  this option demands surrender from a  depleted 
group of the enemy.  If the enemy surrenders,  the party gets all 
of their items and gold.

Greet:  this option greets the monsters in the hopes of  avoiding 
combat. If the monsters don't respond, then the battle is on!

Beg  for Mercy:  this option puts the adventurers down  on  their 
knees, begging the monsters not to hurt them (not a bad idea when 
a party of first levelers run into a hoard of Vampires or  Devils 
or ...).  If the monsters accept the party's surrender they  take 
all of the party's gold, some of its new items, and then leave.

Flee:  this option puts "Fleet" in the adventurer's feet.  If the 
adventurers are successful in fleeing, they will avoid combat; if 
they are unsuccessful the monsters get free shots.

MELEE

If  the party or the monsters decide to  fight,  each  adventurer 
will choose his tactics from the combat menu. Each adventurer has 
the following options:

Combat Menu

* Thrust
* Attack
* Slash
* Lunge
* Aim
* Spell
* Parry
* Fire
* Other
* Front
* Middle
* Back
* Time Lag
* Redo

Thrust:  this option lets the adventurer take one hard,  accurate 
swing  at a monster.  It has the greatest chance of  hitting  and 
does 1-2 points more damage than normal.

Attack: this option lets the adventurer take two normal swings at 
the  monsters.  If  an  adventurer does not have  a  high  enough 
percentage to Attack, he will Thrust instead.

Slash:  this option lets the adventurer take three or four  quick 
swings  at the monsters.  Each individual blow is less likely  to 
hit and does 1-2 points less damage than normal. If an adventurer 
does  not have a high enough attack percentage to Slash  he  will 
Attack instead.

Lunge:  this option is only for fighters;  it lets a fighter take 
one  normal  swing at a monster in the second  rank.  If  a  non-
fighter attempts a Lunge he will Thrust instead.

Aim:  this option lets the adventurer take one swing aimed at the 
monster's head or torso. An aimed blow has less chance of hitting 
than  a  normal attack.  If the adventurer does not have  a  high 
enough attack percentage to Aim his blow, he will Thrust instead.

Spell:  this  option  allows  an adventurer to cast  any  of  his 
everywhere or combat spells.  The adventurer will have to specify 
the spell number, and target when necessary.

Parry:  this option lets the adventurer attempt to parry with his 
shield.  A  successful parry will be displayed by the  adventurer 
raising  his  shield  on screen.  A successful  parry  makes  the 
adventurer  harder  to  hit  and reduces  the  effects  of  enemy 
attacks.

Fire:  this option lets the adventurer fire his bow.  If there is 
more than one rank of monsters, then the rank to be attacked must 
be specified.

Other:  this option opens up a mini-menu of movement and  utility 
options.  After  moving the adventurer may still assign a  combat 
option from the Combat Menu. These options include:

Back:  this  option puts the adventurer at the back of the  party 
where  he is the least likely to hit with,  or be hit  by,  melee 
attacks. Being at the back does not affect spells or bows.


                             PAGE 10
------------------------------------------------------------------
Middle:  this  option  puts the adventurer in the middle  of  the 
party's  fighting ranks where his chances to hit and be  hit  are 
normal.

Front:  this  option  puts  the adventurer at the  front  of  the 
party's  ranks where he has the greatest chance to hit or be  hit 
by melee weapons.

Time Lag:  this utility function defines how long combat messages 
will  remain  on  screen.  The time lag can  range  from  0  (the 
fastest) to 9 (the slowest). The sound may also be toggled on and 
off at this point.

Redo:  the "Woops" option.  This option allows the whole  party's 
combat  options  to  be reset.  When the  entire  party's  combat 
options have been assigned, the Redo option will be given again.
      Thieves,  because  of their stealth and trickery,  have  an 
advantage in melee; they can thrust, attack, or slash at monsters 
in any rank, not just the first.
      After  all of the adventurers' options have been  recorded, 
this  round of combat begins.  Each figure will act as  his  turn 
comes  around.  The  effects of the  adventurer's  and  monster's 
actions  will be displayed in the center-right hand  window.  The 
effects  on  the character's hit points and body  areas  will  be 
displayed at the top of the screen.
      At  the  end  of  every  combat  round  the  monsters  will 
reorganize.  If they are losing badly,  they may attempt to flee. 
If  the  fight continues,  the Encounter Menu will  be  displayed 
again  and an additional round of combat may occur.  Combat  will 
continue until all the monsters are dead,  the party is dead, the 
party  accepts  the monsters surrender  successfully,  the  party 
flees successfully, or the party begs for mercy successfully.

AFTER THE BATTLE

After each battle,  the amount of experience points and gold  the 
adventurers earned is displayed.  The gold is put into the  party 
treasury and the experience will be divided among the adventurers 
when they reach a town.
      If  the fight took place in the  wilderness,  the  monsters 
surrendered, or the adventurers make their Spot Item percentages, 
the  party  might find some treasure (monsters  defeated  in  the 
wilderness  or who surrendered in the dungeon automatically  give 
up  all of their treasure).  A general description of  each  item 
found  is displayed and the party may decide to keep  or  discard 
the item.  Items can not be used until they are distributed in  a 
town.  The  party can carry up to 90 items that they  find  while 
exploring.
      Some fights occur at night while the party is  asleep.  The 
party  is  assumed to mount a watch.  If the character  on  watch 
makes  his Listen percentage,  then he can wake the party  before 
the monsters attack. Otherwise the sleeping adventurers will have 
to  wake up during the melee.  A priest or high level ranger  can 
speed up the process by casting spell 51, Awaken (See Magic).

MORTALITY: HIT POINTS AND BODY AREAS

Everything  can  die;  it's a part of the  adventuring  business. 
Whenever a monster or adventurer sustains damage,  he loses  some 
of his hit points. When his hit points reach 0 he is dead (though 
a  high level Priest might bring him back to life with spell  44, 
Resurrection).
      The number of hit points an adventurer has is based on  his 
level,  class,  and constitution.  The hit point chart shows  the 
number  of  Hit Points an adventurer with a  constitution  of  10 
would have at any given class and level.

__________________________________________________________________

An  adventurer's hit points can be restored to maximum in  several 
different ways.  First,  any stay at an Inn in town or an indepen-
dent  Inn in the wilderness will heal all of an  adventurer's  hit 
points.  Second,  spells 1-4, Healing 1-4, can be cast by a Priest 
or  Ranger.  Each spell heals a random number of points  with  the 
higher  numbered  spells healing many more points than  the  lower 
numbered versions.  Finally, a Healing Potion (rated from strength 
1-10) will restore a given number of hit points per dose.  Any  of 
these methods may be used in combination.
      Each  character  and monster has  6  Body  Locations:  Head, 
Torso, Left and Right Arm, and Left and Right Leg. These Locations 
may be Okay (O),  Injured (I),  Broken (B),  or Gone (G).  In  the 
wilderness,  the condition of each part of the body is shown in  a 
stick figure diagram under the character's status.
      Healing  spells and potions can Heal Body Areas as  well  as 
Hit Points.  Each healing spell or Potion will heal the most vital 
area it can.  Each area Gone counts as 1 Broken and 1 Injured area 
or  3 Injured areas.  Each broken area counts as 2 Injured  areas. 
The  following  chart  lists the  effects  of  different  strength 
Healing spells and potions.

HEALING POTION    HEALING SPELL     AREAS INJURED

     1-3               I            1 Injury
     4-6               II           1 Break or 2 Injuries
     7-9               III          1 Gone, 1 Break & 1 Injury etc
     10                IV           More than 1 Gone


      Hit Points are used separately from Body Areas.  A character 
can die from having his Head or Torso removed,  or from enough hit 
points to an arm to kill him.  It is possible for an adventurer to 
have  all  of his hit points,  but have a  limb  Gone.  It's  also 
possible to have no damaged limbs, but be low on hit points. 
      Staying  at an Inn cures all of an adventurer's hit  points, 
and will cure 1 Break or 2 Injuries.  A visit to the Inn of a town 
is still free. A visit to an independent Inn costs 250 Gold.
      Spells  5-8  (Fireflash)  and  37-40  (Flamebolt)  attack  a 
specific  body  area.  Spells 33-36 (Mindblast)  only  affect  the 
monster's hit points.
      Different  weapons have different chances to  hit  different 
body  areas.  Bows have the best chance to hit the vital  Head  or 
Torso  areas.  Spells have an equal chance to hit all body  areas. 
Hand  held  weapons  have the worst chance to hit  a  vital  area, 
especially against very tall monsters.  The Aim Blow combat option 
allows an adventurer with a hand weapon to aim at a vital location 
at the cost of only taking one blow and a reduced chance to hit. 
      When  a body area is Broken,  it restricts  an  adventurer's 
choice of actions.  An adventurer may not fire a bow if any of his 
Arms  or Legs are Broken.  An adventurer may not cast a  spell  or 
swing  a weapon if his Right Arm is Broken or Gone.  Parry is  the 
only combat option for an adventurer with a broken right arm.

MONSTERS

The  land of Scandor is filled with monsters of  all  types.  Most 
would happily lunch on ground Wizard any day! Each monster has its 
own   unique  personality  and  set  of   characteristics.   These 
characteristics include how big a pack the monsters run around in, 
their attack, damage, defence, armour, hit points, and any special 
powers and spells the monsters know.  Also, each monster can carry 
different  amounts  of gold and treasure and  is  worth  different 
amounts  of  experience.  Finally,  different monsters  will  have 
different reactions when interacting with adventurers.
      Beginning  adventurers  should be careful of  very  powerful 
monsters.  But,  don't worry, there are a number of creatures that 
your party can take on with a reasonable chance of survival.
      Monsters  are  the stuff of legend and rumour so  a  Monster 
Reputation   Table   is  included  to  represent   knowledge   the 
adventurers  have before the quest.  Of course,  not all  monsters 
have been mentioned in the legends, and not all rumours are true!

The  fighting proficiency ratings relate to low level  adventurers 
(it  doesn't  actually matter if beginners run into a Demon  or  a 
High  Demon,  they're chutney either way)!  A beginning party  can 
take  on  low  and medium (Med) quality  monsters  in  about  even 
numbers and expect to win.  A party can only expect to win against 
high proficiency monsters if the party heavily outnumbers them.  A 
beginning  party should do everything in their power to not  fight 
the very high (V High) proficiency monsters.  When the adventurers 
have all gained several levels,  they can come back and try to mop 
up a gaggle of giants (fat chance)!

MAGIC

Magic is the fertilizer that makes PHANTASIE III bloom.  It is  an 
important   weapon   against  monsters  and  the  basis   of   the 
heroes'power in the latter parts of the game.  There are deeds  to 
be  done  and  battles to be won that can only  be  achieved  with 
magic.  The proper combination of melee,  bowfire,  and spells  in 
combat is the basis of success in PHANTASIE III.
      Every  class  of  adventurers has  some  capacity  to  throw 
spells.  Spells  can  be thrown in town,  in  the  wilderness,  in 
dungeons,  and  in combat.  Magic spells are identified  by  their 
Spell  Number,  Magic Point Cost,  Name,  and Type.  Each time  an 
adventurer casts a spell,  it costs him between one and four Magic 
Points depending on the spell.  The adventurer's Magic Points  are 
restored by resting in an Inn or by drinking a Magic Potion.
      Each  adventurer gets a number of Magic Points based on  his 
class and attributes. Whenever an adventurer rests in an Inn after 
using  Magic  Points,  he  has a chance for his  Magic  Points  to 
increase.  The  maximum number of Magic Points an  adventurer  can 
have  depends on his class and level and is given in  the  Maximum 
Magic Points Chart.

All adventurers can eventually learn some spells, but some classes 
require  a high level before any spells are available.  The  total 
number of spells an adventurer can learn is limited by his  class, 
level and intelligence.  Thus, classes that may have many possible 
spells  but who can only learn a few,  such as Rangers and  Monks, 
should be very choosy about which spells they learn.
      Spells  are  divided into a number of  different  categories 
depending on whether the spells can be used and how they interact. 
The different types of spells are:

Combat  Spells:  these spells can only be used during  melee  with 
monsters. They last only for the duration of the combat. There are 
two types of combat spells:
    Passive:  these spells always work, and whenever possible they 
    counter  act  any previously cast spells.  Thus  if  an  enemy 
    wizard  casts  a Slow spell at the party then a  party  wizard 
    could override it with a Quickness spell.

    Active:  the  effectiveness of active spells depends upon  the 
    spellcaster's magic power and experience level as well as  the 
    strength  of the target.  Active spells may have a  cumulative 
    effect. A second Fear spell, for example, can cause the victim 
    to be more afraid than the first spell.  A second Sleep  spell 
    will not deepen a sleeping target's trance, however.

Non-Combat  Spells:  these spells can be used only out of  combat. 
There are four types of non-combat spells:

    Town: these spells can only be cast in a town.

    Wilderness: these spells can only be cast in the wilderness.

    Dungeon: these spells can only be cast in the dungeon.

    Everywhere  Spells:  these  spells  can be  cast  anywhere  at 
    anytime.

The  Spells Available Table lists the spell numbers an  adventurer 
can  learn  at each level.  The Spell Table lists the  spells  and 
their details in spell number order.  Finally,  the Spell List  is 
organized alphabetically and describes each spell in detail.

SPELL LIST

Accuracy  and  Party Accuracy (#55,56):  these  spells  raise  one 
adventurer's, or the whole party's Fire Bow percentage to 250.

Arrow Flame and Party Arrow Flame (#13-16):  these spells increase 
the  accuracy and damage of bow fire for one  adventurer,  or  the 
whole party.  Arrow Flame 1 increases accuracy by +50 percent  and

percent and Bow Point values by +25.

Awaken  (#51):  this  spell  rouses all  sleeping  adventurers  or 
neutralizes a sleep spell.

Binding (#29-32):  these spells inhibit the movement of  monsters, 
making  them easier to hit.  The spells are progressive so that  a 
Binding  3  is stronger than a Binding 1 and Binding  2  combined. 
Binding spells are particularly effective against flying creatures 
and monsters that are difficult to see.

Charm  (#41):  this  spell makes monsters so  friendly  that  they 
forget that they are in combat, until they are attacked.

Confusion (#21-24): these spells make it difficult for monsters to 
use their magic.  The spells are progressive so that a Confusion 3 
is stronger than a Confusion 1 and a Confusion 2 combined.

and other creatures back from the dead to flee or simply dissolve.

Dissolve (#47): this spell causes monsters to simply dissolve away 
to nothing.

Fear  (#46):  this spell frightens monsters into running  away  in 
terror.


                             PAGE 15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fireflash 2    1-30 points of damage
Fireflash 3    1-60 points of damage
Fireflash 4    1-100 points of damage

Flamebolt  (#37-40):  these  spells shoot a sheet  of  flame  that

Mindblast 2    1-11 points of damage
Mindblast 3    1-41 points of damage
Mindblast 4    1-81 points of damage

Monster  Evaluation (#52):  this spell determines the  approximate 
experience  level  of nearby monsters.  Although  it  occasionally 
yields  inaccurate results,  it is a good idea to cast this  spell 
immediately  upon  entering  a dungeon  and  occasionally  in  the 
wilderness.

Ninja  (#45 & 50):  this spell transforms the spellcaster  into  a 
fighter  of super-human ability.  The spell gives the caster  high 
attack,  defense,  and  damage abilities regardless of his  actual 
armor  or weapons.  Ninja 2 is more powerful than  Ninja  1,  even 
though Ninja 1 costs more magic points.

Protection  (#17-20):  this spell increases the  effectiveness  of 
each party member's armor.  The amount of additional armor depends 
on the level of the spell:

increase depends on the level of the spell:

from  the  dead.  The shock of dying will  permanently  lower  the 
victim's Constitution one or two points, however.

Sleep (#42): this spell causes opponents to fall into a daze where 
they cannot attack, parry, or cast spells.

Summon  Elemental (#48):  this spell summons up an elemental  that 
the party has previously loaded in at a guild.  The elementals are 
listed  on the guild roster and one of them must be loaded in at a 
guild before he can be summoned in combat.

Teleportation (#43):  this spell will teleport the party out of  a 
combat.

Transportation (#54):  this spell will transport the party  inter-
dimensionally from one town to another.

Weakness  (#25-28):  these spells cause monsters to lose  strength 
and  so  do less damage when they hit adventurers.  The  spell  is 
progressive  so that Weakness 3 is more powerful  than Weakness  1 
and Weakness 2.

Divine Spells (#57+): these spells may only be acquired during the 
course of the game for special purposes.

TREASURE

Treasure is one of the great rewards for the hearty adventurer  in 
PHANTASIE III. Treasures such as magic weapons, precious gems, and 
ancient  scrolls  with  clues to Scandor's plight  abound  in  the 
wilderness  and dungeons.  Unfortunately,  the party will have  to 
fight  for treasure,  as almost all of these items are guarded  by 
monsters.  There  are  four types of treasure  in  PHANTASIE  III: 
Combat Equipment,  Potions,  Scrolls,  and Other  Valuables.  Some 
items will help the adventurers on their quest.  Other items  will 
be  sold at Armories in towns for gold.  Each type of treasure  is 
its own reward.

COMBAT EQUIPMENT

Combat equipment in PHANTASIE III  includes shields,  armor, melee 
weapons,  and bows. Each item has a set of attribute requirements, 
normally based on Strength.  Only adventurers with high attributes 
can  use heavy equipment.  Note that magical equipment  has  lower 
attribute requirements than normal equipment of equal point value. 
Each type of equipment is listed with its item number,  its  point 
value, its attribute requirements, and its name.

POTIONS

Potions  are magic concoctions that adventurers drink  to  restore 
hit points,  damaged body areas,  or spent magic points. There are 
two different kinds of potions: Healing Potions & Magic Potions.

Healing Potions (#101-110): these potions will restore a number of 
hit  points  to an adventurer and help heal  damaged  body  areas. 
Healing  Potions come in ten different strengths;  the higher  the 
level the greater the power of the healing:

Healing 1        1 pt. healed       1 injury healed
Healing 2        4 pts. healed      1 injury healed
Healing 3        9 pts. healed      1 injury healed
Healing 4        16 pts. healed     1 break or 2 injuries healed

SCROLLS

A number of people have recorded important information on  scrolls 
that  are scattered throughout Scandor.  Some of the  scrolls  are 
available  at  Armories in towns;  others are closely  guarded  by 
monsters.  All together these scrolls hold many of the secrets  of 
the  enemy and how he may be defeated.  Remember that  adventurers 
may only read scrolls by using the Use Item command in a city.

OTHER VALUABLES

Many other valuable treasures exist in the PHANTASIE III universe. 
These  treasures include gems,  objects d'art,  and  one-of-a-kind 
masterpieces.

APPENDIX I: QUICK START

For  those that want to jump right in and "Test  Drive"  PHANTASIE 
III you can use these quick start instructions.

1)  Before you can begin play you must create 2  disks:  a  Player 
disk and a Dungeon disk.  Check the machine specific  instructions 
for  your  computer for information on creating  the  disks.  (Use 
Utilities Menu from PHANTASIE III game to create disks)

2) After you have made the disks,  get back to the Starting  Menu. 
Choose "Start in Pendragon" to begin the game.
3)  Once in the town go to the Guild to get adventurers to form  a 
party.  In  the Guild the List Members command will show  you  six 
adventurers that are already in the guild.  These adventurers  are 
beginning  characters,  but  are already  pre-generated  and  pre-
equipped. They also form a reasonably balanced party to start. Hit 
the  space bar to return to the Guild Menu.  Use the  Add  Members 
command to add the Adventurers from the Guild to your  party.  Now 
exit the Guild.

4)  Go to the bank and withdraw about 500 gold to  cover  expenses 
while you travel. Exit the bank.

5) Next go to the Armory.  Choose a character to be the buyer  and 
then List the items available. Continue the list until the scrolls 
appear.  Buy a couple of scrolls.  Exit the Armory. Choose the Use 
Item command and the character who bought the scrolls. Then choose 
the scrolls from the list.  The information on the scrolls  should 
give  you an idea on what is going on in Scandor and a clue as  to 
where  you  might  want to go.  You are now ready  to  begin  your 
adventure. Leave the town and good luck.

HOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

Many  questions in the game have a menu of different  options.  If 
the menu is numbered,  then input the number to make your  choice. 
If  the names on the menu include a ")" then input the  letter  to 
the left of the bracket to make your choice.  If a question  gives 
you a choice such as "Disarm or Leave" then input the first letter 
of your choice. Many questions want a Yes or No answer; simply hit 
"Y" or "N" to make a choice.  If a screen does not ask a question, 
but leaves a blinking cursor, hit RETURN to continue.
   Whenever you refer to an adventurer outside of the Guild lists, 
you use the adventurer's number in the party.  So,  after you  say 
you want to disarm the trap you will specify the adventurer  (1-6) 
that attempts the disarm.
   When you are outside a town you can you can move four different 
directions on the map. Use the mouse to select.
    This should be enough to get you started into the  world  with 
the  sample  party.  When  you  run into  a  situation  you  don't 
understand look up the rule covering that specific situation. When 
you feel you understand the game and how it works you can go back, 
make up your own party, and go for the gusto.


APPENDIX II: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PHANTASIE III & PHANTASIE I & II 

Players who have already gone through PHANTASIE I or PHANTASIE  II 
will recognize most of the rules for PHANTASIE III.  But,  several 
new rules have been added to PHANTASIE III,  including an expanded 
combat system, additional spells, and revised screen layouts. What 
follows is a summary of these changes.

Going  Up  Levels:  each time a character goes up a level  he  can 
receive  training in three skills.  A chart lists the  character's 
current  level in each skill,  and the effect of training in  that 
skill.  The  character  will also receive an amount of  Gold  that 
depends on his social class.

Social  Class:   each  character  has  a  social  class:  Peasant, 
Labourer, Craftsman, or Noble. Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, and 
Halflings tend to be of the higher classes.  Social Class  affects 
starting money and money received for advancing a level.

Trading:  while in town adventurers may trade items without having 
to redistribute them using the Trading option.

Bows:  bows  have  replaced  thrown rocks as  every  man's  ranged 
weapon.  It is easier to hit an opponent with a bow,  and Armor is 
less effective vs.  them. Thieves get a free +30 to their Fire Bow 
Skill, Elves receive a +15 to Fire Bow Skill.

Body Locations:  each character and monster has 6 Body  Locations: 
Head,  Torso,  Left and Right Arm,  and Left and Right Leg.  These 
locations may be Okay (O),  Injured (I),  Broken (B), or Gone (G). 
In the Wilderness the condition of each part of the body is  shown 
in a stick figure diagram under the character's status.

Healing: healing spells and potions can Heal Body Areas as well as 
Hit Points.  Each Healing Spell or Potion will heal the most vital 
area it can.  Each area Gone counts as 1 Broken and 1 Injured area 
or  3 Injured areas.  Each Broken area counts as 2 Injured  areas. 
The  following  chart  lists the  effects  of  different  strength 
Healing spells and potions.

Healing   Healing   Areas Healed
 Potion    Spell 

  1-3        I      1 Injury
  4-6        II     1 Break or 2 Injuries
  7-9        III    1 Gone, 1 Break & 1 Injury, etc.
   10        IV     More than 1 Gone

Hit  points are used separately from Body Areas.  A character  can 
die  from  having his Head or Torso removed,  or from  enough  hit 
points to an arm to kill him.  It is possible for an adventurer to 
have  all  of his Hit Points,  but have a  limb  Gone.  It's  also 
possible to have no damaged limbs, but be low on Hit Points.
   Staying at an Inn cures all of an adventurer's Hit Points,  and 
will cure 1 Break or 2 Injuries.  A visit to the Inn of a town  is 
still free. A visit to an independant Inn costs 250 Gold.
    Spells 5-8 (Fireflash) and 37-40 (Flamebolt) attack a specific 
Body Area.  Spells 33-36 (Mindblast) only affect the monster's Hit 
Points.
   Different weapons have different chances to hit different  Body 
Areas.  Bows  have the best chance to hit the vital Head or  Torso 
Areas.  Spells  have an equal chance to hit all Body  Areas.  Hand 
Held weapons have the worst chance to hit a vital area, especially 
against  very tall monsters.  The Aim Bow combat option allows  an 
adventurer  with a hand weapon to aim at a vital location  at  the 
cost of only taking one blow and a reduced chance to hit.
   When a body area is Broken, it restricts an adventurer's choice 
of actions. An adventurer may not fire a bow if any of his Arms or 
Legs  are Broken.  An adventurer may not cast a spell or  swing  a 
weapon  if  his Right Arm is Broken or Gone.  Parry  is  the  only 
combat option for an adventurer with a Broken Right Arm.

Monster  Status:  during combat three things will be listed  about 
enemy monsters:  their Rank,  their Name,  and their  Status.  The 
Status of a monster can be:  Unconscious (U),  Sleeping (S),  Down 
(D),  and Okay (K). As an example 3 Gnomes in the 2nd rank who are 
Sleeping, Unconscious, and Down would be listed as:
        2       Gnome(S)    S U D

Sleeping adventurers and monsters are automatically hit in combat. 
Down  adventurers  and monsters are much easier to hit  than  Okay 
targets, but can still dodge.

Adventurer  Positions in Combat:  during combat an adventurer  can 
assume  one of three  positions:  Back,  Middle,  or  Foreward.  A 
character who is Foreward has an increased chance to hit with hand 
weapons,  but an even greater chance to be hit by the monsters.  A 
character who is Back is harder for the monsters to hit,  but  has 
an even harder time hitting the monsters with a hand weapon.
    An adventurer's position has no effect on his chances  to  hit 
with  a  bow.  An adventurer's combat modifiers for  position  are 
calculated  relative  to  the rest of the party.  If  all  of  the 
adventurers  are  Back,  then  none of them  get  any  bonuses  or 
penalties.

Mapping:  Scandor is divided into a 5x5 area referenced by a  grid 
labeled  A  -  E West to East and I to V  North  to  South.  Other 
planes,  dimensions,  have their own labels. All areas are already 
mapped so spell 53 (Vision) is unnecessary.


APPENDIX III: TIPS & HINTS

Playing PHANTASIE III is a big job;  there are hundreds of details 
to keep track of. This section includes a few hints on "good" ways 
to handle some of those details. You'll have to experiment to find 
your own personal "best" solution to the game.

FORMING A PARTY

The  right  combination  of  adventurers is  half  the  battle  in 
PHANTASIE III.  When you choose an adventurer's race and class you 
define  the  chance  of getting  particular  attributes,  not  the 
attributes   themselves.   High  attributes  make  surviving   and 
advancing levels much easier.

Strength:  fighting types need every point they can get. Often the 
only advantage of random creatures is a chance for high STR. Don't 
take a random creature though unless its other Attributes are okay 
too.

Intelligence: all spellcasters need INT; limited spellcasters like 
Monks  and Rangers need every point they can get.  Limited  spell-
casters  receive very few Spells Available,  they shouldn't  waste 
them on middle level junk like FIREFLASH 2 or HEALING 2 when  very 
powerful 3 and 4 point spells are just a couple of levels away.

Dexterity:  great  for everyone but especially for low  Hit  Point 
types like Thieves and Wizards. Try high DEX wizards with no armor 
in the back rank. They are very difficult for the enemy to hit.

Constitution:  again everybody needs CON,  but low Hit Point types 
need it the most. Don't get seduced by a high INT and a low CON.

Charisma:   random  creatures  with  very  low  Charisma  can  get 
prohibitively expensive to train;  watch out! High CHA is a secret 
advantage of Humans, Elves, and Wizards.

   The next thing you have to worry about is equipping the  party. 
You  always  want  the biggest weapons  your  fighting  types  can 
handle.  Grab any bow of 4 points or better for Thieves and  Monks 
who  are out of magic points.  Buy the heaviest armor you can  get 
for  fighters  in the front ranks,  none for Wizards in  the  back 
ranks.

------------------------------------------------------------------
                             PAGE 24

Buy all the low point healing potions you can find. After a couple 
of  levels you'll need all the medium power Magic Potions you  can 
grab.  Magic Weapons are normally too expensive to buy;  find them 
instead.  Finally,  buy,  read, and keep track of every scroll you 
can  get  your hands on;  they're the key to the whole  puzzle  in 
Scandor.

FIGHTING

Your party will be doing lots of fighting in PHANTASIE III, so you 
had  better find good strategies from the start.  There are  three 
things   to  worry  about  when  fighting:   Encounter   Strategy, 
Adventurer Position, and Melee Tactics.
    At  the Encounter Menu you have to figure out  your  Encounter 
Strategy.  Use the Monster Reputation Table to decide if you  want 
to  fight  or  not.  Trying to greet  possibly  friendly  monsters 
doesn't cost you anything, even if they decide to fight. Don't try 
to Accept Surrender right away,  it only works after you've killed 
a percentage of the enemy.  And don't be afraid to Beg for  Mercy, 
especially if you're not currently carrying much gold.  The  party 
should  only try to flee if it is out-matched and  heavily  loaded 
with gold and goodies. 
   Remember,  if you flee and fail the monsters get free shots  at 
your characters.  If you're going to fight, then you need to worry 
about  everyone's  position.  Fighters  should be  placed  in  the 
foreward  rank  where they have the highest  chance  of  striking. 
Spell casters and bowmen can be in the back rank,  where they  are 
less likely to be hit. Note that the ranks are relative positions. 
If  everyone  occupies  the  back rank,  then  no  one  gains  any 
protection.
    When battle starts,  each adventurer has a choice of  tactics. 
Fighters  can  choose  between 1  and  3  swings.  Against  normal 
monsters take as many swings as you can.  Against flying  monsters 
or  ones that are hard to see take only a few.  Thieves with  good 
bows (4+ points) can do as much damage as they can in melee;  keep 
them in the back rank with the Wizards.  Wizards should be careful 
not to overkill the enemy and waste Magic Points;  sometimes  it's 
best to parry and let the Fighters take care of a few monsters.

THE QUEST

No  matter where the party goes on its quest it always comes  back 
to its base, Pendragon. Begin by going into the Pendragon Archives 
just south of the town.  Work your way through the archives  until 
you find the wise man Filmon.  He will direct you on how to  begin 
your quest.  After each adventure go back and consult Filmon again 
for directions to the next part of the quest.
    While  you're  on your quest be careful  about  exploring  the 
dungeons you find. Be ready to retreat if your party gets too beat 
up,  but  explore  enough  so that you're  sure  you  didn't  miss 
anything.  Try to go through the adventure in something resembling 
the  proper  sequence;  if you try to take low  level  adventurers 
through some of the later dungeons they'll get eaten alive!
   Finally,  don't take the program too literally.  A limb  that's 
"Gone"  is probably just so broken that normal rest won't fix  it. 
Monsters that are "Unconscious" are just so groggy that they can't 
fight.  PHANTASIE III is packed with flavorful details; enjoy them 
for the color they add and don't pick too many nits. And remember: 
The  race  is  not  always to the swift,  or  the  battle  to  the 
strong...but God fights on the side with the most artillery!  Good 
luck!



That's it folks, Chuckles.
