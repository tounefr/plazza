         +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


THE GAME:

THE GAME IS A GAME OF SKILL AND FUN.AS GAMES OF SKILL AND FUN GO,THIS IS ONE OF
THE SKILLEST AND FUNNIEST GAMES YOU COULD EVER WISH TO MEET.

YOU CONTROL MR D.P GUMBY AND,UNDERSTANDABLY,YOU HACE TO GET BACK HIS 4 PIECES
OF BRAIN.THIS IS NOT EASY.IF IT WAS,THIS GAME WOULD NOT BE A GAME OF SKILL AND
FUN,NOW WOULD IT?.

THERE ARE FOUR SKILL LEVELS TO THIS GAME,A PIECE OF BRAIN IS BEING HELD ON EACH
SKILL AND FUN LEVEL.THE LEVELS ARE ALL QUITE DIFFERENT IN A SKILL AND FUN
SORT OF WAY,BUT ALL HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS IN COMMON.GOOD THINGS LIKE
SAUSAGES,EGGS,BEANS,SPAM(SKILL)AND CHEESE(FUN) AND BAD THINGS LIKE DEAD
PARROTS.

BECAUSE EACH LEVEL IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN A SKILL AND FUN SORT OF WAY,MR GUMBY
CANNOT ALWAYS WALK,SO,HIS BODY IS CHANGED TO SUIT THE SURROUNDINGS.LIKE ON THE
FIRST LEVEL,WHERE HE IS CHANGED INTO A FISH TO SWIIM IN  THE MAZE LIKE
UNDERWATER CAVERNS.

WHEN EACH LEVEL RUNS OUT THERE IS NO MORE,MR GUMBY IS CHANGED BACK TO
NORMAL(WELL NORMAL FOR HIM)AND HE IS SICK,ALL THE GOOD THINGS PICKED UP ALONG
THE WAY GO IN A BIG HOLE AND ARE COUNTED FOR POINTS.BEST OF ALL THOUGH IF YOU
GOT 16 LOTS OF SPAM MR GUMBY CAN HAVE A PIECE OF HIS BRAIN BACK.THEN YOU HAVE
TO DO IT ALL AGAIN.

USUAL MOVEMENTS TO MOVE MR GUMBY: JOYSTICK LEFT..MOVES HIM LEFT
                                  JOYSTICK RIGHT.MOVES HIM RIGHT GET THE
PICTURE..YEAH EASY AINT IT..(BY THE WAY PRESS FIRE TO THROW A FISH..ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT..YOU KNEW THAT).

HERES A FUN WAY TO PASS THE TIME.BEFORE GUMBY IS SICK HE CAN GET LOTS MORE
POINTS BY ARGUING WITH A MINISTER FOR POINTLESS ARGUMENTS.THE LONGER YOU KEEP
THE ARGUMENT GOING,THE MORE POINTS YOU GET.

HOW TO ARGUE:
SIMPLY CONTRADICT EVERYTHING(NOTHING)THE MINISTER SAYS BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

BEWARE:
AGREE WITH THE MINISTER OR HESITATE TOO LONG AND HE CALLS TIME.THIS MEANS NO
MORE POINTS.

VITALITY:
WHEN THIS BAR IS EMPTY A LIFE IS LOST.THIS BAR GOES DOWN WHEN GUMBY HITS BAD
THINGS AND GOES UP WHEN HE GETS GOOD THINGS.

LIVES:
GUMBY ONLY HAS THREE SO BE CAREFUL.AN EXTRA LIFE IS GAINED FOR EVERY 10,000,000
LOST.

SPAM COUNT:
SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF SPAM COLLECTED.

SCORE:
99,999,999 POINTS AND COUNTS DOWN.THE LOWER THE SCORE THE BETTER.

SECRET BONUSES:
THROW FISH AT VERY SILLY PLACES AND YOU MAY GET SPECIAL BONUS POINTS.

BE QUICK:
BONUS POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR BEING QUICK TO COMPLETE A LEVEL.

CHEESE:
SHOOT THEM WITH THE FISH.BONUS POINTS ARE GIVEN FOR EVERY CHEESE
EXPLODED.EXPLODE ALL THE CHEESE ON EACH LEVEL FOR EXTRA BONUS POINTS.

BAD THINGS:
THERE ARE MANY TO BE FOUND ON EACH LEVEL.SHOOT THEM FOR POINTS OR AVOID
THEM.SOME DO NOT LIKE TO BE AVOIDED AND SOME ARE BIGGER AND BADDER THAN
OTHERS,SOME NEED TO BE HIT BY A FISH MORE THAN OTHERS BEFORE THEY BLOW UP.ALL
OF THEM ARE BAD BECAUSE THEY HURT MR GUMBY AND DRAIN HIS VITALITY.

BONUS SCREENS:
GO UP AND DOWN AND IN AND OUT OF ALL THE HOLES YOU FIND,YOU MAY BE REALLY LUCKY
AND FIND A HIDDEN SECRET SCREEN,WHERE MR GUMBYS HEAD IS STUCK ON A BOUNCY
BOOT.BOUNCE ON THE FOOD BLOCKS OF CHEESE,AVODING THE CHASM BELOW FOR AS LONG AS
POSSIBLE.

SILLIEST SCORERS:
SILLIEST SCORERS GET TO SEE THEIR NAMES IN LIGHTS.MOVE THE JOYSTICK LEFT AND
RIGHT TO MAKE THE FINGER GO IN THE SAME DIRECION.PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON TO POKE
THE LETTERS AND THINGS.
