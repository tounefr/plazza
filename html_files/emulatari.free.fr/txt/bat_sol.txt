 B.A.T. Walkthrough
====================

 TIPS
 ====
 * You can buy a membership card for around 175 krells
 * 50 krells seems enough to loosen most tongues
 * When you leave your hotel room, hide your hotel key outside
 your room so you can't loose him and leave a place in your inventory.
 * If you hear a bleep, it probably means you've been stolen.
 Find out what you've lost, then look around the screen with the
 mouse for people to interpellate. If they try to sell something,
 steal it back and escape when they attack you or buy it.
 * A technician permit costs about 3000 krells
 * Carry food and drink, so you don't get hungry or thirsty at a
 crucial moment. Sushi is good
 * Three or four items are probably all you can eat in one go
 before you throw up. This also happens if you go above 3000 calories.
 * You can only handle one alcoholic drink at a time.
 * Sell something to a cop, then steal it back again. If he tells
 you to give it back let him have it, then steal it back. Repeat
 this operation until you eventually get it back. Don't try this
 with the same cop twice.
 * When you play the bizzy game and managed to get to shape 21,
 you will gain 12.000 credits !!!

 USE OF THE DRAG
 ================
 You can fly over the entire planet surveying Terrapolis in a 3D
 screen.
 You pilot the direction with moving the mouse left-right, the
 speed by pressing left or right (speed up or down). The radar
 helps you to find the Vrangor Station. The red dot is Vrangor
 and the green dot is Selenia.

 USE THE MOBYTRACK
 ===================
 You will come across it when you visit the underground city.
 Simply use the left button on one of the four directions you
 want to travel.

 EDITING YOUR SAVED FILE
 ========================
 Look for the file F1.SAV and change your amount of Krells and
 Credits, your level and life potential. It's better not to change
 the other values (Experience, force,....) otherwise the game will
 lock up.

 OFFSET MAXIMUM VALUE
 34 2710 10.000 Krells
 38 03E8 1000 Credits
 47 60 Level code = 99
 55 60 Life potential = 99

 WALKTHRU THE BAT GAME
 ==========================
 Start looking in the restrooms on the right. There you get your
 mission. Explore the city and make a map of the important places.

 Buy your munition at the gun shop. The best is to get a HAAS
 10 and a MOZ weapon. Buy some T02, E10 and E300 munition

 Buy some force fields (number 7 or 8) in the force field shop.
 Later in the game when you are ready to travel to Vrangor's Station,
 you may buy force field 8 as much as you can to survive to battle
 against the Station.

 Buy some food at the Chin shopkeeper, get some drinks at any bar
 you find, or use the fontain in the park when you are thirsty.
 Visit the doctor and buy some pilles.

 Steal from every alien you encounter until he say something. In
 this way you get some access cards to Xifo (Alien in the museum)
 and the technicians at the airlock. Otherwise you must buy them.

 Go to the night bar at the approach road (opens at 19h.) and find
 the girl in a black zip suit. Ask here about Merigo. She refer to
 a Alien (a kradokid type). Search for that kind of alien around
 the town, and ask about Merigo when you find them. He tells you
 to go to the museum at a certain time... note it down.

 Go to the museum in the park (dont be late) with Krells to give
 him and listen to the exact time you must be at the Xifo club to
 find Merigo. Use the fountain in the park if you are thirsty.

 The xifo club is in the hot area at the N.E. side of the town.
 Use the access card to get in here. Wait for Merigo at the time
 you've been told by the alien in the museum. Kill him and you get
 an electronic key. That key opens the door to the maze which you
 find in the derelict building.

 In the Hot Area (at the start of the A-312 road) you find the Arcade.
 Play Bizzy game between 13h. and 15h. against Sloan to get credits .
 After winning from Sloan you gain his friendship and he will stay
 with you. You need him to get past the guard at the airlock. To win
 the game, you must copy the pattern of shapes onto a piece of paper
 and then as each one appears write next to them the number that the
 shape is.

 At the opposite of the arcade is the club where you find Lydia.
 Before you enter, first put your heart rate on accelerate. Pay
 the 50 krells to enter the club between 2h. and 4h. pm.. Dance with
 Lydia and get the love meter to the top. Now she will stay with you

 If you don't have enough credits to rent a Drag, Lydia will tell you
 the phone number (52031) of her friend Kortakis. Make an appointment
 with him with a phone you find at the space port. Go with Lydia to
 Kortakis. You find him in the hot area past the cinema and the N.E.
 part of the town. Get the credits to rent a Drag. She gets a jewel
 from Kortakis.

 You can explore the maze with Lydia but it's not necessary to finish
 the game. Go to the derelict area and use the electronic key to
 enter to underground of the city. Find the control room with the use
 of lydia's jewel who will lead you to a DOP card. This card helps
 you to find Vrangor's Station when you use the Drag.

 Use the "technicians only" access card that you stole or buy, to
 get past the technicians at the Northern Airlock. Here you find
 information about the Station and the access code (LRRRRRRL) for
 Epsilon. You must have Sloan with you to get past the airlock. Here
 you can rent a Drag for 5500 credits.

 Make sure you have enough munition and shields with you. Use the
 Drag and head for the orange dot which is Vrangor's Station. Fire
 at until it stops moving and firing to you. Fly into the dark area
 of the station

 Put your heart beat on accelerate. Use the Epsilon code at the keypad
 on the right wall in Vrangor's station. Enter and keep firing at
 Vrangor until he dies. The objective of the game is completed, but
 you can still wander around the town and do everything you want to
 do.........

---THE END---
