Suprisingly there is no large doc file that comes with game!
Just a reference card type item.

No object to the game or hints on how to overcome some of the 
obstacles you will encounter are explained.

I assume the object is just to make it to the end of your journey 
(whatever that is????).

OK, we all know how to load a game so no need to tell ya about 
that. One thing though, when you are prompted to put disk B in the 
drive it must remain in for the length of the game.

Skrull is a mouse only game.

Top icon: Press right button to stop.
          Press left button to go to far end (enter).
Second icon from top: Press right button to walk right.
                      Press left button to walk left.
Third icon from top: Press right button to run right.
                     Press left button to run left.
Fourth icon:Press right button to jump backwards and thrust sword.
            Press left button to jump.
Fifth icon: Press right or left button to thrust sword.
Corner icon: Pick up an object.
Icon next to your life level: Drop an object.
Three icons on the other side of your life level show you what 
objects you are holding.

To drop an object you are carrying, click first on the drop icon 
then on the object you want to drop.

And that is all there is to it......
