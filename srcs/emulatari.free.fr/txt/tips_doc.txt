DEFENDER OF THE CROWN
To get 1,024 Knights:  After conquering a territory, press
these four keys at the same time, while the drive is still 
running:  H J K L  ... If you do it just right, you'll have
1,024 knights both in your home and in your army.  Hey, this
is good stuff!
Another way was reported in which to get 1,024 Knights, but
it doesn't seem to work:  After first picking the knight,
when Robin Hood appears, type PATTERSON over and over until
the map of England appears.  Don't press the Return key.
If this trick doesn't work the first time, try again.  
I was only able to get this to work most of the time if,
before typing  PATTERSON  over and over, I first typed in
my name with no spaces:  GEORGEKNOCHEL   Yep, Twilight Zone!
