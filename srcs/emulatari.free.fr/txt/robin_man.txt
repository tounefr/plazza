The Story...          again iam to lazy...
------------


The Controls...
---------------

   A number of Icons will apear down the left-hand side of the screen
   as the game progresses. There may be operated by clicking on them
   with the mouse and, in some cases, via keyboard shortcuts. Additional
   control is achieved by clicking directly onto people or the landscape,
   using the mouse!.

Fixed Icons...
--------------

   Pauses the game (pressing 'P') on the Keyboard has the same effect.
   A menu appears, allowing you to quit or resume the game. There are two
   Quit options - the first [press F1] will save your current position in
   the game to disc, so that next time you play you carry on from where you
   left off; the second option [F2] abandons the game, so that next time you
   play it will start again from the beginning.

   AMIGA... F1 = SAVE /\ F2 = LOAD /\ F3 = SOUND /\ F4 Re-START

   NOTE: Selecting the PAUSE Icon during the opening sequence allows you to
   skip the introductory sequence, and jump directly to the point at which
   ROBIN sits moping outside the walls of the town, thus getting you
   straight into the game without delay!.

   The following icons become avaiable as soon as the introductory sequence
   is over:-  
                            *    *  /  \     force ROBIN to walk about the
ICON-DIRECTION! = *          \  /  *    *    landscape. PRESS on the ICON
                                         to walk; release to stop.

   These icons have keyboard equivalents:

   use              [A]      [S]     [Z]     [X]      keys.

   SELECTING THE:   BOW  |  SWORD |  EYE  | HEART

   See below for other ways of making ROBIN move.

   These are the symbols you use to interact with ROBIN and his
   environment. Selecting one of these symbols is likely (thought not
   guaranteed) to sow the seed of an idea into ROBIN's MIND - sometimes
   simple and explicit, sometimes less so, depending on circumstances.
   We will leave it to you to discover the detailed effect of each symbol
   for yourself, but we are aware of the following actions:-

   ­ Selecting the BOW usually seems to have the effect you'd expect from
     a trigger-happy hero. (keyboard equivalent = [ENTER]).

   ­ The SWORD seems to inspire aggression of a more personal kind.

   ­ The EYE always seems to affect the 'camera' , rather than any
     of the people, causing it to pan so what we can see the same part
     of the landscape that ROBIN can see - it pays to know what perils may
     lie ahead. (Keyboard equivalent = [SPACE].

   ­ The HEART encourages our hero to run rather than walk, but beware of
     excessive demands on his stammina - you never know when he's going to
     need all his energy.

   ­ The LIPS bring out the smooth-talking nature of our man, but what
     he'll actually say is, were afraid, impossible to control.

   ­ The OPEN HAND stands for generosity, in ROBIN's view, and generosity
     is an important quality in a true hero of the people.

   ­ The OPEN HAND is quite the opposite, but one cannot be generous unless
     one has something to give, so this darker quality is likely to turn out
     to be a necessary evil, if ROBIN hopes to have any people left to
     govern once he's completed his main task.

     All the symbol icon's and the winning icons have the following
     properties :-not included...take a look on your screen...and now...

1./  There are two types of symbols icon - some of them act immediately
---  the are pressed, other icons do nothing until after you have selected
     an object on the landscape (person or animal). When you press icons of
     this second type, the mouse cursor will turn into a GREEN hand,
     indicating that you should click on an object. When successful, the
     cursor stops being green and the icon will have its effect. If you
     press one of these icons by mistake, press it again to cancel the green
     hand!

2./  After use, each symbol icon becomes exhausted for a certain amount of
---  time, depending on the particular icon. whilst exhausted, the icon
     will turn to grey and cannot be used. You should use slow-to-recharge
     icons with carem, as you might need them again in a   H U R R Y !!!

W I N N A B L E  I C O N ' s
----------------------------

     There are several other symbol icons which have no meaning at the start
     of the game, and so are not visible.

     You will collect the right to use these icons, which give you access to
     new facilities, as the game progresses (unless of course you make a
     mess of things!).

O T H E R  C O N T R O L S
--------------------------

     In addition to the icons, you can control ROBIN's movement by two other
     means (plus a third option when you win the right to use it).

1./  Clickanywhere directly onto the landscape and a small maker will appear
---  at that point. ROBIN;s attention will be directed towards that place,
     and he will (probably) walk there. Because this method doesn't try to
     control ROBIN's legs directly, ROBIN's own brain is able to deal
     (drugs) with the problems of avoiding abstacles, entering/leaving
     throught doorways, etc. This is probably the best method for getting
     around most of the time. Use the ARROW icons for more precise control
     when needed.

2./  Click on another person (when the cursor is NOT a green hand), and the
---  thought often enters ROBIN's mind that he should follow that person for
     a while.

T H E  H E R O I S M  I N D I C A T O R
---------------------------------------

     The vertical bar near the icons shows the computers current assessment
     of ROBIN's qualities as a hero. The bar is red if it is falling, or
     blue if rising. You will find that almost everything ROBIN's does, or
     you make him do, will have an effect on the level of this bar. As our
     tiny world is supposed to be a 'land fit for heroes',beware of the
     possible consequences of being too much of a villain, or even too much
     of a wimp.

M O N E Y
---------

     As a certain amount of moneyt is bound to change hands during the game,
     we've displayed the current contest of ROBIN's purse as a number at
     the bottom-left of the screen.

P L A Y I N G  T H E  G A M E
-----------------------------

     It is not for us to tell you what you should aim to do, or how to go
     about it. In fact, you are free to do anyhting you like, or even
     nothingat all - perhaps sometimes you should leave ROBIN to get on with
     it for himself. In any event, you are likely to come across varioius
     encounters where you cold be of help to ROBIN or his FRIENDS in some
     way. You may of course not want to be helpful, but if ROBIN is to
     live up to his reputation as a goody-goody, we suspected that he's
     going to need some guidance.

       In the far NORTH-WEST corner of the map lives a wizard-like
       priest (JUDAS? hehehe) of the god Herne. This man-of-the-woods
       is a great ally and can offer much useful advicem as well as a
       helpfull gift. He should be the first person to visit if you get
       stuck.

       To be a hero (like SUB-0) requires a lot of qualities, backed-up
       with the appropriate deeds. Almost everything you encourage ROBIN
       to do will affect his standing as a hero. In particular, remember
       that ROBIN HOOD was renowned as a 'robber of the rich to feed the
       poor'. Unfortunately, the richest are well protected, and the
       merely well-off are strong and well-armed. There is one, however
       who can provide rich pickings; a former friend but now a turncoat
       of the first water.

       Remember that your crimes of robbery and murder will not go unnoticed
       if you whish to retain you freedom to go as you please, then refrain
       from too much crime too early. The more trouble you and your BAND
       cause, the harder it becomes to survive!.

       ROBIN is a leader of men. Sometimes the best trick is to delegate!!
       You'll find that some of the icons have different effects if you
       apply them to the Merry Men............
